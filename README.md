# multi-framework-test-env
A comprehensive testing environment designed to verify the execution of code across multiple programming languages and frameworks. This repository includes boilerplate setups for Node.js, React, Go, and Python, etc allowing developers to quickly check if their code runs successfully. 

Sure, here's a brief walkthrough of how to use the different testing environments you've set up:

1. **Node.js/React Testing Environment**

   This environment is bootstrapped with Create React App. You can start the development server, run tests, build for production, or eject the setup using npm scripts. Refer to the instructions in the README file:

   
```1:34:react-testing-tsx/README.md
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
```


2. **Angular Testing Environment**

   This environment is generated with Angular CLI. You can start the development server, generate new components, build the project, or run unit and end-to-end tests using Angular CLI commands. Refer to the instructions in the README file:

   
```1:27:angular-testing/README.md
# AngularTesting

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.

3. **Vue.js Testing Environment**

   This environment is set up with Vite and Vue 3. You can start the development server, build for production, or run type checks using npm scripts. Refer to the scripts section in the `package.json` file:

   
```6:11:vuejs-testing-tsx/package.json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "run-p type-check \"build-only {@}\" --",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "build-only": "vite build",
    "type-check": "vue-tsc --build --force"
```


4. **Django Testing Environment**

   This environment is set up with Django and a virtual environment. You can start the development server, run tests, or run other Django management commands using the Django manage.py script. However, there are no specific instructions provided in your codebase for this environment.

Remember to install the necessary dependencies for each environment before running the commands. You can typically do this with `npm install` for Node.js environments or `pip install -r requirements.txt` for Python environments.
